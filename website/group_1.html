What are the principles of analysis and design?

<div id="question_1" class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordion">
<div class="card-body">
Website analysis should be conducted regularly and focus on whether the site:
<ul>
<li>Is accomplishing its objectives (e.g. reaching its intended audience or achieving the desired level of traffic)</li>
<li>Is functioning correctly (i.e. the technical aspects of the site are working as intended, the site is responsive and doesn’t suffer downtime)</li>
<li>Features correct and current information</li>
</ul>
The design of a website should also be kept up to date with modern web development techniques.

What are website architectural requirements?
</a>
</div>
<div id="question_2" class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordion">
<div class="card-body">
The architecture of a website should follow a clear and logical design to help users find the page they are looking for with as little trouble as possible. A website’s architecture should look something like a rooted tree graph, with the home page as the root and pages branching out from a navigation menu. Each of these pages will have related pages branching out, forming an intuitive path to follow for users navigating the website. Clearly-designed website architecture is also necessary for effective search engine optimisation, allowing users to find the website in the first place.

What are website design structures, including hierarchy and navigation design?
</a>
</div>
<div id="question_3" class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordion">
<div class="card-body">
Hierarchy refers to the nested arrangement of pages within a website, starting from the most general (i.e. the home page) and increasing in specificity through a series of pages to reach the desired location. Navigation is the way a user travels between pages. User navigation must be designed in a logical, intuitive way, such that a user can intuitively find their way to what they’re looking for in a web page in as few steps as possible. This is often accomplished through the use of a navigation menu accessible from every page on the website.

What are user-interface design requirements and production processes?
</a>
</div>
<div id="question_4" class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordion">
<div class="card-body">
User interfaces for the web should be consistent, using the same elements and design across all pages of a website. The layout should be clear and immediately understandable to new visitors (e.g. using design processes most people will already be familiar with, such as menu bars across the top of the page) and all interactive elements of the site should respond quickly. The production process involve with research into other similar websites to see what design ideas are commonly used, one or multiple rough designs (e.g. a simple sketch on paper), and then the creation of a digital prototype.
